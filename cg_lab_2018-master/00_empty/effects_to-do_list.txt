Points with "-" in front are still TO-Do
Points with "?" in front are already implemented, but not yet described
Points with "x" in front are completely done (impleneted + "algorithmic effects description" done)

--- Attention! ---
This list DOES NOT specify all details needed for an effect implementation, it only summarizes them to give an overview.
When implementing an effect, take a look at the exact Specification in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7IVstmtIvlHYzl1ZWtEb3ZLXzg

--- Minimal requirements --- (algorithmic effects description NOT required)

- Create three independent scenes
- Exactly 30 second camera flight
- Always have at least 1 animated object during entire flight
- Control Camera with WASD+Mouse
- Trigger Animations of individual scenes when manually controlling Camera close to them
- Use displayText(text) to display all currently visible basic & special effects

--- Basic movie effects ---

1) Scene Graph Elements
- a) At least one manually composed model that consists of multiple parts
- b) Separate animation of different parts and as a whole
- c) Scene Graph Node that renders complex 3D shape (5-25 vertices, fully specified properties)

2) Materials
- a) Two clearly different Materials (not Textures!) with specular properties

3) Texturing
- a) Apply texture to 1)c)

4) Illumination
- a) Multiple light sources (at least 1 moving)
- b) Implement at least one spot-light (LightSGNode, Phong Shader)
- c) Phong shading should be applied to all objects in scene.

5) Transparency
- a) At least one object semi-transparent based on Alpha-Texture (look closely at specification!!)

6) Camera
- a) Control camera with forward/backward arrows and Mouse.
- b) Create an additional animated camera flight (suggestion: triggered on key "x"?)

--- Special effects ---

S1) Terrain from heightmap
- Must be implemented using a vertex shader.

S2) Multi texturing
- Mix multiple textures with an alpha map in a shader.

S4) Level of detail
- Three different detail levels in one render node (decide by camera distance to object).
